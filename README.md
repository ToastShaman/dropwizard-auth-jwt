# dropwizard-auth-jwt

A Dropwizard authentication filter using JSON Web Token (JWT). 

## What is it?
JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS).

## What's new in v1.1.3-0
* Updated dependencies to Dropwizard 4.0.0
* Updated dependencies to jose4j 0.9.3
* This is very much my own branch and tweaks of the code while I experiment with JWT and DropWizard. The Upstream project hasn't been updated since 2017 so I'm not sure if it's still maintained.

## What's new in v1.1.2-0
* Updated upstream dependencies to Dropwizard 1.1.2
* Updated upstream dependencies to jose4j to 0.6.0  

## What's new in v1.1.0-0
* Updated upstream dependencies to Dropwizard 1.1.0  

## What's new in v1.0.6-0
* Updated upstream dependencies to Dropwizard 1.0.6 and jose4j to 0.5.5  

## What's new in v1.0.2-0
* Updated upstream dependencies to Dropwizard 1.0.2 and jose4j to 0.5.2  

## What's new in v1.0.0-0
* Replaced the JWT token generation and verification with [jose4j](https://bitbucket.org/b_c/jose4j/wiki/Home). 

## What's new in v0.9.2-0
* Updated the dependencies to Dropwizard 0.9.2.

## What's new in v0.9.1-1
* Added support for CachingAuthenticator.

## What's new in v0.9.1-0

## Getting Started

To use this library in your project you can download it from Maven Central.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.toastshaman</groupId>
    <artifactId>dropwizard-auth-jwt</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.2-0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Example
See this [code example](https://github.com/ToastShaman/dropwizard-auth-jwt/tree/master/src/test/java/com/github/toastshaman/dropwizard/auth/jwt/example) 
if you want to use this code your dropwizard application. Once you have started the example application here are some 
sample requests to generate a valid and an expired token:

```
curl -X GET -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" 'http://localhost:8080/jwt/generate-valid-token'
```

or you can create an invalid token instead to see a failure case with: 

```
curl -X GET -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" 'http://localhost:8080/jwt/generate-expired-token'
```

Once you have a token, you can send it to the following endpoint to get some information about the logged in user:

```
curl -X GET \
-H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE0NDkzMTQwOTUsInN1YiI6Imdvb2QtZ3V5In0.oFXdelQECJrw6_e4gR1HU3ljFvY8zmf2EHDsBnnea7n2UDBipmNDbx3bw-Bzzq-FwtEO6qzageK2jbJxM6JHbQ" \
-H "Cache-Control: no-cache" 'http://localhost:8080/jwt/check-token'
```
